**Agent Engineering Daemon — run a fleet of AI coding agents from your phone.** One Telegram bot, multiple CLI backends (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode), unlimited projects — each Forum Topic is an independent agent session with crash recovery and zero babysitting.

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

> **⚠️** All CLI backends run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (or equivalent). See [Security Considerations](#security-considerations).

## Why this exists

Claude Code's official Telegram plugin gives you **1 bot = 1 session**. Close the terminal and it goes offline. No scheduling. No multi-project support.

**agend** turns Claude Code into an always-on, multi-project AI engineering team you control from Telegram:

| Feature | Official Plugin | agend |
|---------|:-:|:-:|
| Multiple projects simultaneously | — | **N sessions, 1 bot** |
| Survives terminal close / SSH disconnect | — | **tmux persistence** |
| Cron-based scheduled tasks | Session-scoped (expires in 3 days) | **Persistent (SQLite-backed)** |
| Auto context rotation (prevent stale sessions) | — | **Built-in** |
| Permission requests via Telegram | Text-based reply | **Inline buttons** |
| Voice messages → Claude | — | **Groq Whisper** |
| Dynamic instance creation via General topic | — | **Built-in** |
| Install as system service (launchd/systemd) | — | **One command** |
| Crash recovery | — | **Auto-restart** |
| Cost guard (daily spending limits) | Platform-level (`--max-budget-usd`) | **Per-instance daily limits** |
| Fleet status from Telegram | — | **/status command** |
| Daily fleet summary | — | **Scheduled report** |
| Hang detection | — | **Auto-detect + notify** |
| Peer-to-peer agent collaboration | — | **Built-in** |

## Who is this for

- **Solo developers** who want Claude working on multiple repos around the clock
- **Small teams** sharing a single bot — each team member gets their own Forum Topic
- **CI/CD power users** who want cron-scheduled Claude tasks (daily PR reviews, deploy checks)
- **Security-conscious users** who need explicit permission approval for tool use
- Anyone who's tired of keeping a terminal window open just to talk to Claude

## Key features

### Fleet mode — one bot, many projects

Each Telegram Forum Topic maps to an independent Claude Code session. Create a topic, pick a project directory, and Claude starts working. Delete the topic, instance stops. Scale to as many projects as your machine can handle.

### Scheduled tasks

Claude can create cron-based schedules via MCP tools. Schedules survive daemon restarts (SQLite-backed).

```
User: "Every morning at 9am, check if there are any open PRs that need review"
Claude: → create_schedule(cron: "0 9 * * *", message: "Check open PRs needing review")
```

Available MCP tools: `create_schedule`, `list_schedules`, `update_schedule`, `delete_schedule`

Collaboration MCP tools: `list_instances`, `send_to_instance`, `start_instance`, `create_instance`, `delete_instance`

Schedules can target a specific instance or the same instance that created them. When a schedule triggers, the daemon pushes the message to Claude as if a user sent it.

### Context rotation

Watches Claude's status line JSON. When context usage exceeds the threshold or the session reaches its max age, the daemon performs a simple restart:

```
NORMAL → RESTARTING → GRACE
```

1. **Trigger** — context exceeds threshold (default 80%) or `max_age_hours` reached (default 8h)
2. **Idle barrier** — waits up to 5 seconds for current activity to settle (best-effort, not a handover)
3. **Snapshot** — daemon collects recent user messages, tool activity, and statusline data into `rotation-state.json`
4. **Restart** — kills tmux window, spawns fresh session with the snapshot injected into the system prompt
5. **Grace** — 10-minute cooldown to prevent rapid re-rotation

No handover prompt is sent to Claude. Recovery context comes entirely from the daemon-side snapshot.

### Peer-to-peer agent collaboration

Every instance is an equal peer that can discover, wake, create, and message other instances. No dispatcher needed — collaboration emerges from the tools available to each agent.

**Core MCP tools:**

- `list_instances` — discover all configured instances (running or stopped) with status, working directory, tags, and last activity
- `send_to_instance` — send a message to another instance or external session; supports structured metadata (`request_kind`, `requires_reply`, `correlation_id`, `task_summary`)
- `start_instance` — wake a stopped instance so you can message it
- `create_instance` — create a new instance with a topic from a project directory (supports `--branch` for git worktree isolation)
- `delete_instance` — remove an instance and its topic
- `describe_instance` — get detailed info about a specific instance (description, tags, model, last activity)

**High-level collaboration tools** (prefer these over raw `send_to_instance`):

- `request_information` — ask another instance a question and expect a reply (`request_kind=query`, `requires_reply=true`)
- `delegate_task` — assign work to another instance with success criteria (`request_kind=task`, `requires_reply=true`)
- `report_result` — return results to the requester, echoing `correlation_id` to link the response to its request

Messages are posted to the recipient's Telegram topic for visibility. Sender topic notifications are only posted for instance-to-instance messages (not from external sessions).

If you `send_to_instance` a stopped instance, the error tells you to use `start_instance()` first — agents self-correct without human intervention.

#### Fleet context system prompt

On startup, each instance automatically receives a fleet context system prompt that tells it:

- Its own identity (`instanceName`) and working directory
- The full list of fleet tools and how to use them
- Collaboration rules: how to handle `from_instance` messages, when to echo `correlation_id`, scope awareness (never assume direct file access to another instance's repo)

This means instances understand their role in the fleet from the first message, without any manual configuration.

### General Topic instance

A regular instance bound to the Telegram General Topic. Auto-created on fleet startup, it serves as a natural language entry point for tasks that don't belong to a specific project. Its behavior is defined entirely by its project's `CLAUDE.md`:

- Simple tasks (web search, translation, general questions) — handles directly
- Project-specific tasks — uses `list_instances()` to find the right agent, `start_instance()` if needed, then `send_to_instance()` to delegate
- New project requests — uses `create_instance()` to set up a new agent

Use `/status` in the General topic for a fleet overview. All other project management is handled by the General instance through natural language.

### External session support

You can connect a local Claude Code session to the daemon's channel tools (reply, send_to_instance, etc.) by pointing `.mcp.json` at an instance's IPC socket:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ccd-channel": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/dist/channel/mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "CCD_SOCKET_PATH": "~/.agend/instances/<name>/channel.sock"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The daemon automatically isolates external sessions from internal ones using env var layering:

| Session type | Identity source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Internal (daemon-managed) | `CCD_INSTANCE_NAME` via tmux env | `ccplugin` |
| External (custom name) | `CCD_SESSION_NAME` in `.mcp.json` env | `dev` |
| External (zero-config) | `external-<basename(cwd)>` fallback | `external-myproject` |

Internal sessions get `CCD_INSTANCE_NAME` injected by the daemon into the tmux shell environment. External sessions don't have this, so they fall through to `CCD_SESSION_NAME` (if set) or an auto-generated name based on the working directory. This means the same `.mcp.json` produces different identities for internal vs external sessions — no configuration conflicts.

External sessions appear in `list_instances` and can be targeted by `send_to_instance`.

### Graceful restart

`agend fleet restart` sends SIGUSR2 to the fleet manager. It waits for all instances to go idle (no transcript activity for 10s), then restarts them one by one. A 5-minute timeout prevents hanging on stuck instances.

### Telegram commands

In topic mode, the bot responds to commands in the General topic:

- `/status` — show fleet status and costs

Project management commands (`/open`, `/new`, `/meets`, `/debate`, `/collab`) were removed in v0.3.4. The General instance now handles these tasks via natural language — just tell it what you need and it will use `create_instance`, `start_instance`, or `send_to_instance` as appropriate.

### Permission system

Uses Claude Code's native permission relay — permission requests are forwarded to Telegram as inline buttons (Allow/Deny). When Claude requests a sensitive tool use, the daemon surfaces it to you in Telegram and waits for your response before proceeding.

### Voice transcription

Telegram voice messages are transcribed via Groq Whisper API and sent to Claude as text. Works in both topic mode and DM mode. Requires `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env`.

### Dynamic instance management

Instances are created through the General instance using `create_instance`. Tell the General instance what project you want to work on — it creates a Telegram topic, binds the project directory, and starts Claude automatically. Instances can also be created with `--branch` to spawn a git worktree for feature branch isolation. Deleting a topic auto-unbinds and stops the instance. Use `delete_instance` to fully remove an instance and its topic.

### Cost guard

Prevent bill shock when running unattended. Configure daily spending limits in `fleet.yaml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  cost_guard:
    daily_limit_usd: 50
    warn_at_percentage: 80
    timezone: "Asia/Taipei"
```

When an instance approaches the limit, a warning is posted to its Telegram topic. When the limit is reached, the instance is automatically paused and a notification is sent. Paused instances resume the next day or when manually restarted.

### Fleet status

Use `/status` in the General topic to see a live overview:

```
🟢 proj-a — ctx 42%, $3.20 today
🟢 proj-b — ctx 67%, $8.50 today
⏸ proj-c — paused (cost limit)

Fleet: $11.70 / $50.00 daily
```

### Daily summary

A daily report is posted to the General topic at a configurable time (default 21:00):

```
📊 Daily Report — 2026-03-26

proj-a: $8.20, 2 restarts
proj-b: $2.10
proj-c: $0.00 ⚠️ 1 hang

Total: $10.30
```

### Hang detection

If an instance shows no activity for 15 minutes (configurable), the daemon posts a notification with inline buttons:

- **Force restart** — stops and restarts the instance
- **Keep waiting** — dismisses the alert

Uses multi-signal detection: checks both transcript activity and statusline freshness to avoid false positives during long-running tool calls.

### Rate limit-aware scheduling

When the 5-hour API rate limit exceeds 85%, scheduled triggers are automatically deferred instead of firing. A notification is posted to the instance's topic. Deferred schedules are not lost — they will fire on the next cron tick when rate limits are below threshold.

### Model failover

When the primary model hits a rate limit, the daemon automatically switches to a backup model on the next context rotation. Configure a fallback chain in `fleet.yaml`:

```yaml
instances:
  my-project:
    model_failover: ["opus", "sonnet"]
```

The daemon notifies you in Telegram when a failover occurs and switches back to the primary model when rate limits recover.

### Topic icon + idle archive

Running instances get a visual icon indicator in Telegram. When an instance stops or crashes, the icon changes. Idle instances are automatically archived — sending a message to an archived topic re-opens it automatically.

### Permission countdown + Always Allow

Permission prompts now show a countdown timer that updates every 30 seconds. An "Always Allow" button lets you approve all future uses of a specific tool for the current session. Decisions are shown inline after you respond ("✅ Approved" / "❌ Denied").

### Daemon-side restart snapshot

Before each context restart, the daemon saves a `rotation-state.json` with recent user messages, tool activity, context usage, and statusline data. The next session receives this snapshot in its system prompt, providing continuity without relying on Claude to write a handover report.

### Service message filter

Telegram system events (topic rename, pin, member join, etc.) are filtered out before reaching Claude, saving context window tokens.

### Health endpoint

A lightweight HTTP endpoint for external monitoring tools:

```
GET /health  → { status: "ok", instances: 3, uptime: 86400 }
GET /status  → { instances: [{ name, status, context_pct, cost_today }] }
```

Configure in `fleet.yaml`:

```yaml
health_port: 19280  # top-level, default 19280, binds to 127.0.0.1
```

### Webhook notifications

Push fleet events to external endpoints (Slack, custom dashboards, etc.):

```yaml
defaults:
  webhooks:
    - url: https://hooks.slack.com/...
      events: ["restart", "hang", "cost_warn"]
    - url: https://custom.endpoint/ccd
      events: ["*"]
```

### Discord adapter (MVP)

Connect your fleet to Discord instead of (or alongside) Telegram. Configure in `fleet.yaml`:

```yaml
channel:
  type: discord
  bot_token_env: CCD_DISCORD_TOKEN
  guild_id: "123456789"
```

### External adapter plugin system

Community adapters can be installed via npm and loaded automatically:

```bash
npm install ccd-adapter-slack
```

The daemon discovers adapters matching the `ccd-adapter-*` naming convention. Channel types are exported from the package entry point for adapter authors.

## Quick start

```bash
# Prerequisites
brew install tmux        # macOS

# Install
npm install -g @suzuke/agend

# Interactive setup
agend init

# Start the fleet
agend fleet start
```

## Commands

### Telegram commands (General topic)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Show fleet status, context %, and costs |
| `/reload` | Restart fleet with new code (requires launchd service) |

All other operations (create/delete/start instances, delegate tasks) are handled by the General instance through natural language.

### Fleet management

```bash
agend fleet start               # Start all instances (not needed with launchd)
agend fleet stop                # Stop all instances
agend fleet restart             # Graceful restart (wait for idle, same code)
agend fleet restart --reload    # Restart with new code (launchd auto-restarts)
agend fleet status              # Show instance status
agend fleet logs <name>         # Show instance logs
agend fleet history             # Show event history (cost, rotations, hangs)
agend fleet start <name>        # Start specific instance
agend fleet stop <name>         # Stop specific instance
agend fleet cleanup             # Remove orphaned instance directories
agend fleet cleanup --dry-run   # Preview cleanup without deleting
```

### Schedules

```bash
agend schedule list             # List all schedules
agend schedule add              # Add a schedule from CLI
agend schedule delete <id>      # Delete a schedule
agend schedule enable <id>      # Enable a schedule
agend schedule disable <id>     # Disable a schedule
agend schedule history <id>     # Show schedule run history
```

### Topic bindings

```bash
agend topic list                # List topic bindings
agend topic bind <name> <tid>   # Bind instance to topic
agend topic unbind <name>       # Unbind instance from topic
```

### Access control

```bash
agend access lock <name>        # Lock instance access
agend access unlock <name>      # Unlock instance access
agend access list <name>        # List allowed users
agend access remove <name> <uid>  # Remove user
agend access pair <name> <uid>  # Generate pairing code
```

### Setup & service

```bash
agend init                      # Interactive setup wizard
agend install                   # Install as system service (launchd/systemd)
agend install --activate        # Install and start immediately
agend uninstall                 # Remove system service
agend export [path]             # Export config for device migration

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20
- tmux
- Claude Code CLI (`claude`)
- Telegram bot token ([@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- Groq API key (optional, for voice transcription)

## Security considerations

Running Claude Code remotely via Telegram changes the trust model compared to sitting at a terminal. Be aware of the following:

### Telegram account = shell access

Any user in `allowed_users` can instruct Claude to run arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. If your Telegram account is compromised (stolen session, social engineering, borrowed phone), the attacker effectively has shell access. Mitigations:

- Enable Telegram 2FA
- Keep `allowed_users` minimal
- Use `pairing` mode instead of pre-configuring user IDs when possible
- Review the Claude Code permission allow/deny lists in `claude-settings.json`

### Permission bypass (`skipPermissions`)

The `skipPermissions` config option passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to Claude Code, which disables all tool-use permission prompts. This means Claude can read/write any file, run any command, and make network requests without asking. This is Claude Code's official flag for automation scenarios, but in a remote Telegram context it means **zero human-in-the-loop for any operation**. Only enable this if you fully trust the deployment environment.

### `Bash(*)` in the allow list

By default (when `skipPermissions` is false), agend configures `Bash(*)` in Claude Code's permission allow list so that shell commands don't require individual approval. The deny list blocks a few destructive patterns (`rm -rf /`, `dd`, `mkfs`), but this is a blocklist — it cannot cover all dangerous commands. This matches Claude Code's own permission model, where `Bash(*)` is a supported power-user configuration.

If you want tighter control, edit the `allow` list in `claude-settings.json` (generated per-instance in `~/.agend/instances/<name>/`) to use specific patterns like `Bash(npm test)`, `Bash(git *)` instead of `Bash(*)`.

### IPC socket

The daemon communicates with Claude's MCP server via a Unix socket at `~/.agend/instances/<name>/channel.sock`. The socket is restricted to owner-only access (`0600`) and requires a shared secret handshake. These measures prevent other local processes from injecting messages, but do not protect against a compromised user account on the same machine.

### Secrets storage

Bot tokens and API keys are stored in plaintext at `~/.agend/.env`. The `agend export` command includes this file and warns about secure transfer. Consider filesystem encryption if the host is shared.

## Known limitations

- Only tested on macOS
- Official telegram plugin in global `enabledPlugins` causes 409 polling conflicts (daemon retries with backoff)
